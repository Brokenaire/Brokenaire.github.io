      <div id="blog"><p id="para_0_original">Cryptocurrency and crypto investment are hot topics in the news, but what does it all mean?</p><p id="para_1_original">First of all, let's start with a definition. Cryptocurrency is digital currency that uses cryptography for security and verification, usually stored in a digital ledger called a blockchain. It's commonly associated with bitcoin, but there are other cryptocurrencies out there as well—and they're all growing in popularity.
</p><p id="para_2_original">Crypto investment is the process of buying and holding cryptocurrencies in order to make money from rising prices or fluctuations in value. There are many different ways to do this, but one of the most popular methods is through trading on cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase or Binance</p><p id="para_3_original">Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency (there were many before it!) and it has been around since 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto first released a white paper describing how bitcoin would work. It's become wildly popular since then because of its low transaction costs, wide acceptance across borders, low inflation rate (which means it doesn't lose value over time), and decentralized nature (no government-run institutions).
</p><img src="img_0.jpeg" alt="blog image 0" id="img_0_original"><p id="para_5_original">I'm so excited to see all the new cryptocurrencies entering the market. I got a few tips for you—and I can't wait to see where this goes!
</p><p id="para_6_original">First, if you're thinking about investing in cryptocurrency, there are a few things you should know before you dive in. 

First, if you don't already have one, get yourself a wallet. You'll need one in order to buy and sell your crypto (more on that later). 

Second, don't make the mistake of investing all your money at once—that is one sure way to lose it all! Instead, set aside a little bit each month so that when prices go up or down, you still have enough money to make it through the season without having to sell off everything at once.</p><p id="para_7_original">
